Welshfox's MultiBot Utility.
https://github.com/welshfox/MultiBot-Utility/
reach me on discord: welshf0x#1724


Should work with most bots for - Pokemon Go.


IMPORTANT:
IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS TOOL THEN I RECCOMEND USING THE COMPILED VERSION!!
Look under the 'Releases' tab on GitHub for the actual compiled versions.

NEWS:
Proxy support is implemented and it can handle a per account proxy setup.
Read more in the config to understand how it works. If no Proxy is used 
then enter 'False' into the field. 

REMEMBER:
You need to install your bots into the folder and write the folder names
correctly into the config. Also, you need to initially setup the config for
the bots you are adding so the tool will work.


README FIRST: 
This bot can handle multiple accounts.
You can also enable auto restart mode and configure the timer.
It can also handle multiple types of bots.
All bot directories need to be placed within the 'Bots' folder.
Config files need to be set up before the utility will work. (See below)
Once a '_MBUTemp' file has been generated, use it to change your settings from that point on.

IMPORTANT CONFIG SETUP:
The MultiBot tool relies on specific strings in order to change your configs.
To make the MultiBot Utility work you need to prepare the bot's config as follows:
Change the starting latitude to: MULTIBOTLATITUDE
Change the starting longitude to: MULTIBOTLONGITUDE
Change the account type field to: MULTIBOTACCOUNTTYPE
Change the Google username field to: MULTIBOTGOOGLEUSERNAME
Change the Google password field to: MULTIBOTGOOGLEPASSWORD
Change the PTC username field to: MULTIBOTPTCUSERNAME
Change the PTC password field to: MULTIBOTPTCPASSWORD
NOTE: If Google and PTC share the same login info fields:
Change the shared username field to: MULTIBOTSHAREDUSERNAME
Change the shared password field to: MULTIBOTSHAREDPASSWORD
